# Discord Noot Bot

This bot allows the user to summon Pingu in a Discord voice chat and yell a "noot".

## Usage

use `!noot` to call the but with a random noot voiceline

use `!noot glitch` or `!noot loud` for some special voice lines (This one requires the user to have a special **NootPass** role)

use `!noot @User` to "mark" someone that is not in a voice chat so the next time they join, the bot will instantly join them to give a glorious noot. Note that this will also work with the glitch and loud argument. (This feature is persistent, meaning that the mark will be saved and the bot will still have the marks even if it goes offline and back online). This also works using the Discord user ID, this can be useful if the user wants to mark someone without notifying the target with a mention. :)
